Time Complexity:
    Assuming that in each folder, there and n files(ordinary files and folders altogether) and m files. Then in each folder the time complexity of the operation performed is
    O(n) = O(m) + O(n -m) + c

Space Complexity:
    If all the files match the the space complexity is O(n)
