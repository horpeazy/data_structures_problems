I decided to use recursion because it's cleaner.

The recusrive function is dependent on the size of the user and group in a particular group instance
assuming that there are n users and m group then the recusrive function is

T(N) = T(n) + T(m) + c

Space Complexity:
The function doesn't store any variable at run time except for function calls on the stack
